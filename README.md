## Data Cleaning 🧹

- Converted object data types to strings.
- Checked for duplicated rows (none found).
- Identified and filled missing values.
- Renamed the column `Total_Amount` to `Total_Sales`.
- Exported the cleaned dataset as `sales_data_cleaned.xlsx`.
- 
## Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA 📊

- **Mean Total Sales:** $396.5
- **Median Total Sales:** $200 (right-skewed distribution)
  
The median is significantly below the mean, indicating a right-skewed distribution. This skewness is due to two dates with exceptionally high sales (January 10 and April 5), as shown in the histogram with a pronounced right tail

|                | Date_ordinal | Quantity   | Price      | Total_Amount |
|----------------|--------------|------------|------------|--------------|
| Date_ordinal   | 1.000000     | 0.103176   | -0.189638  | -0.253372    |
| Quantity       | 0.103176     | 1.000000   | -0.423792  | -0.199315    |
| Price          | -0.189638    | -0.423792  | 1.000000   | 0.892401     |
| Total_Amount   | -0.253372    | -0.199315  | 0.892401   | 1.000000     |



**Correlation Analysis:** Strong positive correlation between Price and Total_Sales (as expected, since Total_Sales = Price × Quantity). Visual analysis shows a downward sales trend over time.
